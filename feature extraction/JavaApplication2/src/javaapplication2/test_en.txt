is
my
home
page,
with
examples
of
some
of
my
hobbies.
At
the
moment,
I
have
some
questions
and
answers
about
digital
video
cameras.
I
also
have
raytraced
images
and
some
utility
programs
related
to
computer
graphics.
Making
music
is
another
one
of
my
interests,
but
I
don't
have
the
disk
space
(well...
or
the
talent)
to
put
it
online.

A
big
welcome
from
Gary
Sims
This
is
Gary
's
homepage
and
it
is
not
exciting
in
anyway
whatsoever
and
its
brief!
All
the
real
activity
happens
over
on
my
blog:
Simo's
Sagacity
(The
quality
of
keen
and
farsighted
penetration
and
judgment).
I
have
a
web
directory
and
also
if
you
are
intrested
I
have
some
bookmarks
and
a
page
of
interesting
links.
You
can
email
me
on
gary
at
garysims
dot
co
dot
uk
or
at
gmail.com
(see
bottom
of
page)
You
can
download
my
PGP
Public
key
from
here.
If
I
have
helped
you
in
some
way
and
you
want
to
show
your
appreciation
then
you
can
donate
$5
to
me
here.
Brevity
My
liege,
and
madam,
to
expostulate
what
majesty
should
be,
what
duty
is,
why
day
is
day,
night
night,
and
time
is
time,
were
nothing
but
to
waste
night,
day
and
time.
Therefore,
since
brevity
is
the
soul
of
wit,
and
tediousness
the
limbs
and
outward
flourishes,
I
will
be
brief.
