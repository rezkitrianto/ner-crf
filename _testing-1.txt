G-number B-MISC

A O
(G)raphics B-MISC
researcher's I-MISC
G-number I-MISC
is O
calculated O
as O
the O
number O
of O
papers/books/citations O
on O
(G)oogle B-MISC
Scholar I-MISC
that O
contain O
more O
than O
200 O
cites. O
Note O
that O
the O
best O
way O
to O
search O
Google B-MISC
scholar I-MISC
seems O
to O
be O
by O
using O
the O
first O
initial O
of O
the O
first O
name, O
e.g. O
" O
r B-PER
fedkiw I-PER
". O
(G)eez, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
citation O
indexes O
out O
there, O
I O
just O
felt O
like O
we O
needed O
another O
one. O
Note O
that O
G O
comes O
before O
H O
(as O
in O
h-humber), O
and O
that O
G O
also O
stands O
Graphics, O
Google, O
and O
even O
Goober. O
This O
is O
only O
a O
partial O
list O
that O
I O
put O
together O
when O
I O
was O
bored O
one O
day. O
No O
omissions O
or O
errors O
are O
intentional, O
but O
rather O
an O
indication O
of O
my O
competence. O
Please O
feel O
free O
to O
email O
me O
corrections, O
additions... O
or O
even O
a O
complete O
list. O
Since O
this O
has O
been O
posted, O
I O
have O
received O
emails O
about O
a O
few O
people O
who O
collaborate O
with O
graphics O
folks O
(applied O
math, O
computer O
vision O
and O
robotics O
researchers) O
and O
have O
added O
some O
suggested O
names O
to O
the O
list O
- O
just O
for O
fun... O
NOTE: O
I O
will O
periodically O
update O
the O
names O
on O
this O
list O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
ability, O
but O
finding O
new O
names O
to O
add O
to O
the O
list O
is O
more O
difficult O
- O
emails O
pertaining O
to O
this O
are O
greatly O
appreciated! O
